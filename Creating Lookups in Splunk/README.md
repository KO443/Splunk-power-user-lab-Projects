A lookup is a file that contains static data that is not an index, this could be a CSV of all the PC in an office. They can have data that is being updated to them which in such case we will need a KV store Lookup. For this lab i will only be working with Static data lookup. 

Lookups can also be used to pull information from files during searches.
