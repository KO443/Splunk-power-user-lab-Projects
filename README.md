*****************************************************
*I created this hands-on Splunk lab projects after my certified Splunk Core Power User certification showcasing variety of Splunk features and capabilities i learned while using study Materials like the Udemy course “Zero to Power User” by Hailie Shaw*
<br>
<br>
*The learning materials and mock data in this repository are derived from the official Splunk documentation and the Udemy course “Zero to Power User” by Hailie Shaw gave me more insigts on how to use Splunk SIEM and it prepared me for my certification. I used these resources as a foundation while building my own customized lab environment, creating personalized workflows, alerts, and dashboards to reinforce and apply the concepts I learned.*

*Helpful Tip: My workstation monitor is very wide, so the screenshots in this README may appear small. For better and higher quality version of the screenhsots, right-click any of the image and open the image link it in a new tab to view the SPL search strings and details more clearly. Also i may have written "serach" instead of "search" because i type too fast at times, so of you come across that i meant to write "**search**"*.
