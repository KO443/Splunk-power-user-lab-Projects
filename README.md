**# Splunk-lab-Project**

I created this hands-on Splunk lab projects after my certified Splunk Core Power User certification showcasing variety of Splunk features and capabilities.

<br>
The learning materials and mock data in this repository are derived from the official Splunk documentation and the Udemy course “Zero to Power User” by Hailie Shaw. I used these resources as a foundation while building my own customized lab environment, creating personalized workflows, alerts, and dashboards to reinforce and apply the concepts I learned.

Pro Tip: My workstation monitor is very wide, so the screenshots in this README may appear small. For better clarity, right-click any image and open it in a new tab to view the search strings and details more clearly.
