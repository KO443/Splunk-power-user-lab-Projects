In this lab, I demonstrate how to create visualizations using SPL commands, followed by configuring formatting options and selecting appropriate chart types in the visualization panel.
<br><br>
 - Using a **Timechart command** - which is an SPL visualization command that displays statistical trends over time. This search queries the **web** index and uses the** timechart command** to calculate the daily average of the **bytes** field, grouping the results by **host**, producing a time-series view that shows how the average amount of data transferred changes over time for each host.
