In this repository, we will download Splunk Enterprise directly from the official Splunk website and extract the installation package.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Splunk Enterprise includes a 60-day free trial. After the trial expires, you can still search your data, build dashboards, create reports, write SPL queries, and continue hands-on practice. All previously indexed data remains accessible. The main limitations after the trial are the loss of scheduled searches, alerts, user accounts, and certain enterprise-level features.

<br>
<br>
This lab begins by downloading and installing Splunk Enterprise, followed by downloading tutorial mock data that will be used as indexed data throughout the exercises.
<br>
<br>
<br>
To download the Splunk ZIP installer:
<br>
Create a Splunk account.
<br>
Go to your Splunk account dashboard.

To download Splunk’s training data for use as mock data in this lab, go to Splunk’s website and search for “search tutorial.” The tutorial files can be difficult to locate, but these are the correct training datasets to download.
