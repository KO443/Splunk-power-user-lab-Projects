In this lab, we’ll explore several methods for extracting fields in Splunk, including using the Event actions dropdown, the Fields Extraction menu in the GUI (Regex and Delimiters options), as well as SPL-based extraction techniques using the rex and erex commands

In Splunk, we use regex for extracting fields from unstructured data and delimiters for parsing structured data, and we apply the rex and erex commands when performing field extractions directly in SPL.
