<p align="center"> Downloading the CIM App in Splunk


**************
CIM stands for **Common Information Model**, and it is is used to normalize data in Splunk. This means it provides a standardized framework for how all data sources should be structured so that fields follow consistent naming conventions across different indexes and sourcetypes. As a result, all incoming data can be searched in a uniform way throughout the Splunk environment.

in this Long lab, I will downloadthe CIM app and make some data CIM-Compliant using the **CIM Add-On Builder**, i'll begin this  hands-on Lab by installing the CIM app in Splunk.

1. Before Installing CIM, I first went to **Settings**, then **Data Models** to show that my Splunk environment currently contains only two data models, both of which are default models that come preinstalled in Splunk.

2. To download the CIM app, start on Splunk’s home page, click **Apps** in the top-left corner, and then select **Find More Apps** to browse the available add-ons. See my steps in the screeshot below
