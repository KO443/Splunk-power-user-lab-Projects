<p align="center"> Downloading the CIM App in Splunk


**************
CIM stands for **Common Information Model**, and it is is used to normalize data in Splunk. This means it provides a standardized framework for how all data sources should be structured so that fields follow consistent naming conventions across different indexes and sourcetypes. As a result, all incoming data can be searched in a uniform way throughout the Splunk environment.
