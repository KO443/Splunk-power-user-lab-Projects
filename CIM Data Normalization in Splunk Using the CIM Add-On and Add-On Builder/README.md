<p align="center"> Downloading the CIM App in Splunk


**************
CIM stands for **Common Information Model**, and it is is used to normalize data in Splunk. This means it provides a standardized framework for how all data sources should be structured so that fields follow consistent naming conventions across different indexes and sourcetypes. As a result, all incoming data can be searched in a uniform way throughout the Splunk environment.

in this Long lab, I will downloadthe CIM app and make some data CIM-Compliant using the **CIM Add-On Builder**, i'll begin this  hands-on Lab by installing the CIM app in Splunk.

1. Before Installing CIM, I first went to **Settings**, then **Data Models** to show that my Splunk environment currently contains only two data models, both of which are default models that come preinstalled in Splunk.
